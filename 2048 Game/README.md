# 2048 Game
## Summary
This was an assignment I worked on in my Introduction to Software Development class. The assignment consisted of creating a Module Interface Specification, UML Class diagram, Control Flow Chart, the 2048 game itself and finally JUnit tests. The game was coded using Java and contains two demos. The first is a manual demo, only till the user gets 8, which takes user input in the for of up, down, left or right being manually typed by the user. The second is an automatic demo, only till the program gets 128, which cycles through the direction getting to the goal by chance. The game runs in a text based GUI in the terminal and consists of a 4 x 4 matrix made using a nested arry. The goal of the game is the same as the original where the game starts with two 2s and after each move 2s are randomly added to the board. The user has to move the board to double like numbers in order to reach the goal numberm, 2048.

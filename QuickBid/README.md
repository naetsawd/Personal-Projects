# QuickBid
## Introduction
QuickBid is a simple auction site I worked on in an effort to learn how to use the Django framework and CSS.

## Features
### Navigation
For a user that has not logged in yet the navigation options are Active Listings, Categories, Log In & Register. Upon registering and loggin in the user is greeted with a few new options where Log In & Register have been replaced by Log Out, Sell, Watchlist & Your Listings. In addition, on the top right the user is also informed that they are not logged in or what account they are currently logged into.
